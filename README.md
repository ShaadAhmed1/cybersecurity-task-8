# cybersecurity-task-8

Objective
The objective of this task was to gain hands-on experience with Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and understand their role in protecting online privacy and securing communication. This involved setting up and using a free VPN client, verifying its functionality, and researching key concepts related to VPN technology.

Steps Taken
1. The following steps were completed as part of this task:

2. A reputable free VPN service (ProtonVPN or Windscribe) was chosen and a new account was created.

3. The VPN client was downloaded and installed on the local machine.

4. A connection was established to a VPN server.

5. The IP address was verified to have changed using a service like whatismyipaddress.com. A screenshot of the new IP address was taken to serve as proof of connection.

6. Web browsing was performed to confirm that internet traffic was being routed through the encrypted VPN tunnel.

7. The VPN was disconnected, and a comparison was made between the browsing speed and the IP address with and without the VPN active.

8. Extensive research was conducted on VPN encryption methods and privacy features.
