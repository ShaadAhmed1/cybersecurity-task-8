# cybersecurity-task-8

Objective
The objective of this task was to gain hands-on experience with Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and understand their role in protecting online privacy and securing communication. This involved setting up and using a free VPN client, verifying its functionality, and researching key concepts related to VPN technology.

Steps Taken
1. The following steps were completed as part of this task:

2. A reputable free VPN service (ProtonVPN or Windscribe) was chosen and a new account was created.

3. The VPN client was downloaded and installed on the local machine.

4. A connection was established to a VPN server.

5. The IP address was verified to have changed using a service like whatismyipaddress.com. A screenshot of the new IP address was taken to serve as proof of connection.

6. Web browsing was performed to confirm that internet traffic was being routed through the encrypted VPN tunnel.

7. The VPN was disconnected, and a comparison was made between the browsing speed and the IP address with and without the VPN active.

8. Extensive research was conducted on VPN encryption methods and privacy features.

Summary of the benefits and limitations of VPNs:

Benefits:
Enhanced Privacy: VPNs mask your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic, making it difficult for ISPs, hackers, and others to track your online activity and location.

Secure Communication: By creating an encrypted tunnel, a VPN protects your data from being intercepted while in transit, which is especially useful on public Wi-Fi networks.

Limitations:
Reduced Speed: The encryption process and the distance to the VPN server can slow down your internet connection.

Not Complete Anonymity: While a VPN significantly boosts privacy, it doesn't offer complete anonymity. A user can still be identified through other methods like browser fingerprinting or by logging into accounts.

Provider Logging: Not all VPN providers adhere to a "no-log" policy, meaning some may still record your activity.

No Protection from All Threats: A VPN is not a catch-all solution; it does not protect you from threats like phishing, malware, or viruses.
